# If the stock was at a price x then one month later it was at a price y â‰ƒ x then it was a Hold

# TODO: Separete the data in train and test (buy, sell, hold) -> 70% train, 30% test
# TODO: Check how was the params like P/E Ratio when stock was a buy, sell or hold and so one for other params
# That will be the input of the neural network
